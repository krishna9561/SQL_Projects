# IMDB Movie Ratings SQL Project 🎬📊

## Description
This is my **first SQL project**, where I analyze **IMDB movie ratings data** using SQL queries. The project focuses on extracting insights about movies, ratings, production houses, bookings, and customer behavior. It demonstrates the use of **joins, aggregate functions, window functions, and filtering conditions** to answer real-world questions.

## Key Features
- Identify **top-rated movies** and **production companies**.  
- Analyze **multilingual movies** and their performance.  
- Track **customer booking trends** and **total tickets sold**.  
- Calculate **total revenue** for a given period.  
- Determine the **longest-running movies**.  
- Use of **SQL concepts**: CTEs, joins, aggregate functions, window functions, and filtering.

## Dataset
The project uses **IMDB movie and ratings data**, with tables such as:
- **movie**: Contains movie details (title, production company, languages, runtime, etc.).  
- **ratings**: Includes median and average IMDB ratings.  
- **bookings**: Cinema hall booking details.  
- **customers**: Customer information related to bookings.

## SQL Concepts Practiced
- **JOINs**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN  
- **Aggregate Functions**: COUNT, SUM, AVG  
- **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER, RANK  
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**  
- **Filtering**: WHERE, BETWEEN, POSITION  
- **Sorting & Ranking**: ORDER BY, DESC

## Example Queries
- Top 2 production houses producing the most hits among multilingual movies.  
- Customer with the most bookings.  
- Total revenue between specific dates.  
- Movie with the longest runtime.  
- Count of bookings per customer.

## Outcome
This project strengthens my **SQL querying skills** and helps in analyzing real-world movie and booking datasets, providing insights useful for **business reporting and analytics**.
